    <h3>These are the bees knees!</h3>
    <p>When we say that, we actually mean they just stick to your head like a bee sticks to a flower, because these headphones are meant for people who love an active lifestyle and want to hear their surroundings as much as their music. Their innovative bone-conduction technology means that they aren't over, on, or even in-ear headphones, instead they sit on your temples and beam your beats directly into your brain!</p>

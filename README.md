What is Hedfon?

Hedfon is an e-commerce website based around the sale of various high quality headphones and headphone products. The general tone to be set by the website is that of a dedicated group of audio enthusiasts and as a result carries with the stereotype a little pretentiousness and a tasteful sprinkle of unprofessional verbiage. A feel of exclusivity and inclusivity are to be maintained in a careful balance through all messaging and visuals.
